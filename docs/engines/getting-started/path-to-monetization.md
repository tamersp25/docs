# Earn Revenue with Veritone 
As a developer partner in the Veritone Ecosystem, there are several ways to earn revenue from your software products.

It is our goal to provide significant and tangible revenue to developer partners.  In fact several of our partners have already earned seven figures based on the millions of media hours we process, and the multiplying factor of utilizing several engines at once for some client use cases.

Veritone can serve as your primary sales channel, but we also help established businesses with existing direct or indirect sales channels. You can also choose to white-label so as not to interfere with other channels or create pricing conflict if you want.

## Engine Licensing Fees
We usually compensate engine developers based on variable engine usage, measured in either hours of media processed or API calls made. Rates are negotiated with each partner, and we prefer tiered pricing based on volume with no guarantees. We are open to discussing other models as well, including flat fees, perpetual licenses, or per feed fees, but we generally prefer a variable cost structure. 

A typical tiered structure would look like this (illustration only):

0-1,000 hours = $Z
1,000-10,000 hours = $Z x 90%
10,000 - 100,000 hours = $Z x 75%
100,000 - 1 million hours = $Z x $60%
Over 1 million hours = $Z x 50%

Veritone's proprietary technology stack includes Conductor, which optimizes results by automatically choosing the best cognitive engine(s) for each processing job based on a combination of accuracy, processing speed, and client cost constraints. Accuracy and processing speed are predicted based on previous behavior. Conductor is currently an optional feature available only for transcription, but it will continue to expand to other cognitive classes (intraclass Conductor) and across cognitive classes (interclass Conductor) over time.

Otherwise, Veritone often guides its clients to the best engine(s) for each job based on our experience with your engine and target budgets. Actual processing volume for any given engine will depend on the number of clients that try and ultimately use the service.  Please keep in mind that processing volume is also highly dependent on the efficacy and pricing of your solution in comparison to other similar software.

If your engine calls a Cloud API, we understand you bear the compute cost so your price may need to be higher. In other deployment models, Veritone bears the compute cost so license fees should reflect this lower overhead cost on your part.

Veritone calculates the license fees generated from each individual data processing job, and aggregates this for reporting on a monthly basis so you can generate invoices to Veritone. We are currently working on developer dashboards that will enable you to view processing hours and license fees for each day as well as an automated payment solution.

## Application Licensing Fees
Veritone enables developers to build unique apps on top of our technology platform via a suite of APIs. Developers can take advantage not only of Veritone's portfolio of cognitive engines, but also modular elements of our standard UI, data and metadata storage, search functionality, single sign-on and other features.  Some Engine developers may deploy Apps over time, and vice versa.

App revenue is most often derived from charging either a seat license or access fee, incremental to what a client pays for the core Veritone platform.  This could be monthly, annual, or perpetual.  We agree on appropriate pricing, and split revenue 70/30 (30% to Veritone).  In some cases you may wish to provide your application for free as incentive to drive paid engine utilization usage instead.

Veritone will collect all application revenue from its clients and pay you as a developer every month for new revenue earned.

If your application also generates third-party (not your own) Engine processing revenue for Veritone, you can earn an additional 7% revenue share on that revenue stream.  Bear in mind that Veritone must pay another party for those Engine License fees, which is why the revenue share is much smaller.  But hey - you are supposed to be in the app business, remember?

## Dataset Licensing Fees
The business model for Dataset licensing is still a work in process and will continue to evolve over time. There are a number of types of data that could generate license fees - training data sets, structured data feeds, even data normalization adapters and schemas.  At this early stage we are open to discussion and suggestion as to how we can work together to create a market for your data products.
