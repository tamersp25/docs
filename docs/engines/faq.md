# FAQ

##### Q: I'm not that familiar with Docker, is this a requirement for engines?

<p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, a Docker container can be developed quite easily with the limited functionality of accepting a JSON payload with instructions, calling your API to hook to any backend technology, and post the results to our database.  Please refer to the documentation regarding Docker [here]|(https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).</p>

##### Q: Will Veritone consider an exclusive deal within a Cognitive Class, in exchange for a discounted engine license price, so that I can be guaranteed my engine will earn more volume?

<p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>A:</strong>  No, our Ecosystem is designed to be a meritocracy which creates some natural competition based on accuracy, speed, and price.  We do not do exclusive deals as a result.</p>

##### Q: Will Veritone provide an estimated projection of how many processing hours will be potentially available in a given cognitive class? How much money can I make?

<p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>A:</strong> We understand that we are asking potential partners to make an investment of time and resources to build one or more Docker containers to our specifications, and that projected volume would be helpful to justify this investment.  Please understand that the Veritone ecosystem is constantly evolving, and actual processing volume and associated revenue are highly dependent on accuracy, speed, cost, deployment model, and output features in a competitive environment.  We endeavor to match the best engine(s) for each specific client use case, and there is a wide spectrum of clients with differing needs and budgets.  We process millions of hours of media each year, often with multiple engines, and this pace continues to grow rapidly.  There is sizable business opportunity for partners with best-of-class solutions, and we have several partners who have earned more than $1 million in processing fees to date.  We believe the upfront work required pales in comparison to the long-term revenue opportunity, provided the engine products meet the expectations of a subset of our client base.</p>

##### Q: Will Veritone promote my engine on its platform when it launches, or provide other PR and marketing support?

<p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>A:</strong>  As a general rule we do not provide preferential treatment to any engine partner.  Engine partners should understand and accept that this is a "white label" opportunity.  We cannot agree to joint press releases, or we would set the expectation of doing this for every new engine partner.</p>

##### Q: How many companies will I be competing against in my specific area of focus?

<p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>A:</strong>  It is difficult to ascertain how many different engine offerings there will be in any given cognitive category, but we do expect the numbers to grow significantly over time.  The earlier a partner joins the platform, generally the more market share they will earn due to our reliance on performance data over time (all else being equal).</p>

##### Q: Will Veritone share my engine processing data with other engine partners?

<p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>A:</strong>  We intend to develop a benchmarking mechanism within Veritone Developer Application that will provide stack rankings of your engine(s) in relation to others, on a blind basis such that other competitors are not listed by name.  We believe this type of benchmarking will assist all developers to continue to refine and improve their offerings over time.</p>

##### Q: I'm concerned about protecting my Intellectual Property, how can I be sure that my executable code will be secure if I provide it in a Docker container?

<p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>A:</strong>  We understand you may have potential concerns about your IP.  Veritone's systems have been built with this in mind, our clients never have access to the Dockers on our system or the code contained inside.  The Terms & Conditions for our Developer App also specifically prohibit any attempt to reverse engineer your code.</p>

##### Q: How does Conductor choose which engines will run on each file?

<p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>A:</strong>  See additional information on Conductor <a href="/#/architecture-overview?id=engine-orchestration" target="_blank">here</a> under 'Engine Orchestration'.</p>
