## Let's Partner

Ready to partner? Let's get the conversation started: follow the steps below to package and deploy your AI tech via the Veritone Developer application for review by the Veritone Ecosystem Team. Once approved and commercial terms agreed upon, launch your tech publicly to Veritone aiWARE customers.

## Start Here

In the aiWARE platform, cognitive runtimes are called cognitive engines. Write your engine in any language. Deploy it as a Docker container. Let us worry about the rest.

Here's the quickest way to get started building your cognitive engine:

- Pick your [cognitive class and capability](/). If you don't see a matching capability, don't worry. Reach out to Support to discuss how best to implement your custom engine.
- Create your free account with [Veritone Developer](/), aiWARE's development environment (you will need this in step 3).
- Use our [Engine Toolkit SDK](/) to package, deploy, and test your engine.
- Once you've packaged and submitted your cognitive engine to Veritone, you're ready to monetize your engine! Review the [Path to Monetization](/) guide.

For technical and business-related questions, please reach out to us on [Slack](/). We're here to help!
