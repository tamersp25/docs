# Build Intelligence into your App

You don't need a Ph.D. in rocket science to add Machine Learning to an app within your infrastructure. All you need is Veritone's Machine Box technology. You get:

- Isolation: Everything runs inside the container - your data stays with you.
- Scalability: Deploys everywhere: as many instances as you need.
- Predictable pricing: Free for you, simple subscription fees for enterprise.
- Easy APIs: Dead simple usage suitable for developers of any level with interactive console built right into the box.
